1) What happens when you initialize a repository?Why do you need to do it?

  A hidden git folder is inserted into the directory/repository when you
  initialize a repository. Without the git folder changes to files within the
  repository cannot be tracked, therefore you can't revert files to previous
  states.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area is different from the repository and working
  directory because it allows you to define the files that will go into the
  repository when you make a commit. It's valuable because you don't always want
  every file within a directory to be included with a commit.
