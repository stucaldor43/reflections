1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
  work local?

  If you are working with other people then having a remote repository is very
  useful because it makes it much easier for everyone to collaborate with one
  another.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
  automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  There may be situations where for some reason or another you don't want the
  branch that you are working on to be updated with the latest code changes.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
  use one instead of another?

  Fork creates a copy of the files within a given repository, creates a new
  repository on your Github account, and places the copies within the newly
  created repository. Clone copies the files from a given repository into the
  specified directory on your computer. Branches store commit history. All
  changes to a given branch only affect that branch.

  You use clone if you want to collaborate with the owner of a given repository
  (pushing/pulling have to be approved by them). Use fork if you just want to
  use the files within a repository for yourself. Use branches if you are
  working on something which you don't want on the main branch.
